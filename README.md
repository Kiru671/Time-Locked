## Premise

- Two people are locked inside two memories of a house distant in time. One in the past and one in the present. A murder has taken place and their only escape is to find what exactly took place. To do so, two players must cooperate without ever being together. They send each other clues and items through cracks in time to solve puzzles and progress the story and ultimately figure out the mystery of the house.

## Story
Bir oyuncu 1970â€™lerin sonlarÄ±nda, diÄŸeri ise 2000â€™lerin baÅŸÄ±nda aynÄ± eski malikÃ¢nede gezinir. AmaÃ§larÄ±; yÄ±llar Ã¶nce yaÅŸanmÄ±ÅŸ, aÃ§Ä±klanamayan bir Ã¶lÃ¼m vakasÄ±nÄ±n ardÄ±ndaki gerÃ§eÄŸi ortaya Ã§Ä±karmaktÄ±r.

GenÃ§ bir kadÄ±nÄ±n hayatÄ±nÄ± kaybetmesiyle sonuÃ§lanan bu olay, yÄ±llardÄ±r sessizliÄŸe gÃ¶mÃ¼lmÃ¼ÅŸtÃ¼r.
Ancak evde bulunan eski mektuplar, parÃ§alanmÄ±ÅŸ belgeler, karalanmÄ±ÅŸ raporlar ve gizli bÃ¶lmeler, bu hikÃ¢yede bir ÅŸeylerin eksik olduÄŸunu gÃ¶stermektedir.

Oyuncular, farklÄ± zamanlardaki odalarÄ± araÅŸtÄ±rarak, ipuÃ§larÄ±nÄ± birbirleriyle paylaÅŸmalÄ±, geÃ§miÅŸle geleceÄŸi birbirine baÄŸlayan bulmacalarÄ± birlikte Ã§Ã¶zmelidir.

GerÃ§ek, sadece birlikte hareket ederlerse ortaya Ã§Ä±kabilir.

# 1st Sprint

- **Sprint Notes:** User stories were written as kanban cards in the right-most column. Associated tasks can be seen marked with;

PurpleðŸŸª for **Programming**,

YellowðŸŸ¨ for **Art/Design**,

RedðŸŸ¥ for **Narative / Story Development**,

Blue ðŸŸ¦ for **Audio**,

GreenðŸŸ© for **Project Management**.

- The User Stories have three different tags.

Gray â¬› for Goal,

Cyan ðŸŸ¦ for Activity,

Burgundy ðŸŸ¥ for Task.

Burgundy for tasks. 

- *Total story points for tasks in the first sprint is*: 72 points.
- *Method of Estimation*: Estimated how long each task would take in hours by talking to person associated with the task, then gave them points based on the fibonacci sequence (1-2-3-5-8...).


- **Daily Scrum**: Daily scrums have mainly been held on WhatsApp, and were aided with occasional Google Meets sessions. Below are the screenshots of our chats.

* **Sprint Review:**
Sprint has been going better than we initally expected. 

Our networking features were quickly integrated and narration through puzzles is going strongly, although the first sprint doesn't seem to have been enough to finish it completely. 

Sevde mentioned that she wants to shoulder more tasks on the programming side as it aligned with her skills.

We failed to implement audio systems and gather proper requirements for it at this stage. We missed the total goal point by a few.


* **Sprint Retrospective:**
We decided to split the story creation phase into two including a rough outline and a final draft later on in phase two. 

Narrative has also missed the target since we underestimated requirements. We missed the total points by a few but we are still happy about where we are as a team.

It was decided that Sevde would handle more on the programming side.

We decided to be more careful updating the next task backlog and not underestimate how long each one would take.

# 2nd Sprint

- *Total story points for tasks in the first sprint is*: 88 points.
- *Method of Estimation*: Estimated how long each task would take in hours by talking to person associated with the task, then gave them points based on the fibonacci sequence (1-2-3-5-8...).


- **Daily Scrum**: Daily scrums have again, mainly been held on WhatsApp, and we held occasional Google Meets sessions as we deemed fit. Below are the screenshots of our chats.

  * **Sprint Review:**
Team clearly lost communication during some bits of development. We might have grown overconfident.

Puzzle development still went well. Although some systems still need time to be ***fully*** integrated, which wasn't the plan.

Team did not expect to have an increased need of communication due to deliverables having to be integrated with one another and failed to adapt.

We missed our target goal of story points by a few. Most features are done seperately but integration has been a hassle.

But belief remains firm overall goals are still achievable.





* **Sprint Retrospective:**
Since most of the hassle of integration has been overcome, although at a cost, a need for stricter and clearer requirements on the development side were deemed unnecessary for the upcoming sprint.

This does not mean the lack of communication is acceptable however. The team all confirmed that they would attend daily scrums and do their best not to miss it.

Shorter times between task updates were agreed upon, with at least two status updates per day, even if no progress was made.

# 3rd Sprint

- *Total story points for tasks in the first sprint is*: 76 points.
- *Method of Estimation*: Estimated how long each task would take in hours by talking to person associated with the task, then gave them points based on the fibonacci sequence (1-2-3-5-8...).

  * **Sprint Review:**


Team acknowledged that we were far frmo giving it our all after the middle of the 2nd sprint. This unfortunately continued until the end of this sprint.


Many puzzles and content for the game was created however, so there is a lot of unrealized potential, we all agreed.


We were off by 26 points, having completed 50 out of 76 that was our goal for sprint 3.


Sprint review attendees: Kerem YÄ±ldÄ±z, Arif DaÄŸ, Sevde Nur TaÅŸkÄ±n.
