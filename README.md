## Premise

- Two people are locked inside two memories of a house distant in time. One in the past and one in the present. A murder has taken place and their only escape is to find what exactly took place. To do so, two players must cooperate without ever being together. They send each other clues and items through cracks in time to solve puzzles and progress the story and ultimately figure out the mystery of the house.

## Story
