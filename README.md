## Premise

- Two people are locked inside two memories of a house distant in time. One in the past and one in the present. A murder has taken place and their only escape is to find what exactly took place. To do so, two players must cooperate without ever being together. They send each other clues and items through cracks in time to solve puzzles and progress the story and ultimately figure out the mystery of the house.

## Story
Bir oyuncu 1970â€™lerin sonlarÄ±nda, diÄŸeri ise 2000â€™lerin baÅŸÄ±nda aynÄ± eski malikÃ¢nede gezinir. AmaÃ§larÄ±; yÄ±llar Ã¶nce yaÅŸanmÄ±ÅŸ, aÃ§Ä±klanamayan bir Ã¶lÃ¼m vakasÄ±nÄ±n ardÄ±ndaki gerÃ§eÄŸi ortaya Ã§Ä±karmaktÄ±r.

GenÃ§ bir kadÄ±nÄ±n hayatÄ±nÄ± kaybetmesiyle sonuÃ§lanan bu olay, yÄ±llardÄ±r sessizliÄŸe gÃ¶mÃ¼lmÃ¼ÅŸtÃ¼r.
Ancak evde bulunan eski mektuplar, parÃ§alanmÄ±ÅŸ belgeler, karalanmÄ±ÅŸ raporlar ve gizli bÃ¶lmeler, bu hikÃ¢yede bir ÅŸeylerin eksik olduÄŸunu gÃ¶stermektedir.

Oyuncular, farklÄ± zamanlardaki odalarÄ± araÅŸtÄ±rarak, ipuÃ§larÄ±nÄ± birbirleriyle paylaÅŸmalÄ±, geÃ§miÅŸle geleceÄŸi birbirine baÄŸlayan bulmacalarÄ± birlikte Ã§Ã¶zmelidir.

GerÃ§ek, sadece birlikte hareket ederlerse ortaya Ã§Ä±kabilir.

* **Sprint Review:**
Sprint has been going better than we initally expected. 

Our networking features were quickly integrated and narration through puzzles is going strongly, although the first sprint doesn't seem to have been enough to finish it completely. 

Sevde mentioned that she wants to shoulder more tasks on the programming side as it aligned with her skills.

We failed to implement audio systems and gather proper requirements for it at this stage. We missed the total goal point by a few.


* **Sprint Retrospective:**
We decided to split the story creation phase into two including a rough outline and a final draft later on in phase two. 

Narrative has also missed the target since we underestimated requirements. We missed the total points by a few but we are still happy about where we are as a team.

It was decided that Sevde would handle more on the programming side.

We decided to be more careful updating the next task backlog and not underestimate how long each one would take.
